              <h6>When updating a Cardinal application using the built-in updater:</h6>
              <p>The application will connect to a GitHub server. The data that GitHub may record is out of Cardinal's control.</p>

               <li>* Intended usage means using the Cardinal software as it was designed to be used. Why is this important? Cardinal ships with 3rd party open source code (rendering engine, Node.js, and more), which the user can access by bypassing the Cardinal code. If bypassing or manipulating Cardinal code causes untended server communication (i.e., crashing Chromium in a way that automatically sends a bug report to a 3rd party), this would not be considered intended usage.</li>
